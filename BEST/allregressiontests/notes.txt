	Scenario: #1) Article ID test

		Given I have found this particular article ID on devbestof.azcentral.com: "http://devbestof.azcentral.com/winners/2014/14744910/best-star-making-machine-valley-youth-theatre"
		When I put that same article ID into the bestof.pnj.com site: "http://devbestof.pnj.com/winners/2015/14744910"
		Then I should not see the article content, but I should be redirected to the homepage of "http://devbestof.pnj.com/"


    Scenario: #4) Checking social media features
        Given I am on the current article page again at "http://devbestof.azcentral.com/winners/2014/14744893/best-kids-activity-childrens-museum-of-phoenix" and I want to share this page via the sharing tools
        Then the data-text should contain the correct article title for sharing via Facebook
        And the href should contain the correct URL for sharing via Twitter
        And the href should contain the correct URL for sharing via GooglePlus
        And the href should contain the correct mailto for sharing via E-mail


    Scenario: #5) Map / Zoom buttons test

        Given I am on this page: "http://devbestof.pnj.com/winners/2015/14745222/best-wedding-reception-venue-5eleven-palafox-event-hosting" where this is both a map and video

        When I click on the "Map" button on the main image

        Then I should see the div that holds the 'Zoom in' and 'Zoom out' buttons on the right side of the map at these coordinates: 'position: absolute', 'right: 20px', 'top: 0px', and have 'margin: 5px' - therefore they are NOT at the same location as the media buttons

        Then I should see in the chinchilla css file that div that holds the media buttons on the left side of the map are at these coordinates, 'position: absolute', top: 0', and 'left: 0, - therefore they are NOT at the same location as the map zoom in & out buttons


	Scenario: #6) PNJ has a single internal content type test

		Given I am on "http://devbestof.pnj.com/winners/2015/"
		When I click on the "Readers' Choice" link
		Then I should be on "http://devbestof.pnj.com/winners/2015/results?types=Readers%27%20Choice" and I should NOT see the 'Readers' Choice' button on the left-side of the page


	Scenario: #7) Azcentral has two internal content types test

		Given I am now on "http://devbestof.azcentral.com/winners/2014/"
		When I then click on the "Critics' Picks" link
		Then I should be on "http://devbestof.azcentral.com/winners/2014/results?types=critics%27%20picks" and I SHOULD see 'Readers' Choice' and 'Critics' Picks' links on the left-side of the page

	Scenario: #9) Login test on PNJ

		Given I am on the PNJ site of "http://devbestof.pnj.com"
		Then there should be no 'login' button





#1, yes
#2, yes, but might need modification unless the data is unchanged
#3, #4, #5, can probably be combined, still relevant, but the functionality has changed.
#6, yes
#7, we can probably drop, in favor of #9 and a test specific to getting video to play
#8, yes
#9, yes
#10, Not sure about this one - seems relevant ( you will need to make the call on this one)
#11, As #10
#12 and #13, drop in favor of #14, since a failure in a step in #14 would be reflective of #12 and #13 failing
#14, yes
#15, yes
