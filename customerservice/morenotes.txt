This is an employee customer service webapp that will allow any employee to take a complaint or request and funnel it to the proper channel.  It is just a collection of links to current pages, but they have all been collected in one hand place to speed the process along. 

Here is the test link 
http://archive.desmoinesregister.com/assets/LDSNDESIGN/cust-serv-app/app.html

once this is approved we can move it to the support.indystar.com subdomain where it will stand.

Phil's original comments:

Test this web app to make sure all links render properly and that the click actions in PHXDEV-1558 are reporting properly. 

1. Email customer service button -  this links off to a formstack form on a static indystar page http://static.indystar.com/customer/service/ 

2. Subscribe - Sends people to the ion subscription page of the IndyStar http://offers.indystar.com/specialoffer?gps-source=CPHPPRIMARY&onSuccessRedirectURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indystar.com%2F

3. Free trial sends people to the free trial ion page 

4. This sends the user out of the web abb to the Chat functionality 

5. Links to the sites FAQ in static
