./setup cacahootie uscp-web bugfix/GDPWEB-4643-CareerbuilderContact # exit the shell when it dumps you to the vagrant box at the end
cd web-standard-apps
git fetch
git checkout bugfix/GDPWEB-4643-CareerbuilderContact
cd ../
./run
```
https://github.com/GannettDigital/gdp-magic

one more thing, after you do the setup, you should change the SITE_KEY in uscp-web/manage.py to “app"

i was going to automate that… but haven’t yet
too many steps, sorry
still refining the process

so i just need to run those 6 lines in my terminal?
yep
from the gdp-magic dir
(or starting there at least)
ok. should i follow the directions at that git repo as well?
the git repo will get gdp-magic itself setup
there’s a step in there of running ./setup
so basically the 6 lines plus the edit to manage.py are swapped in for that one line
you do these things in this order precisely, don’t ask why
do them in quick succession




Feature: New Careerbuilder Tests

	In order to make the new contact form live on Careerbuilder
	As a Gannett employee with access to the correct urls
	I want to be able to test for these scenarios

    Scenario: Testing form

    	Given I am on "http://localhost:8000/career-builder/contact-us/"
    	When I enter "Testing" in the 'First Name' field
    	Then I enter "Form" in the 'Last Name' field
    	Then I enter "(602) 555-1234" in the 'Phone' field
    	Then I enter "tdolezal@azcentral.com" in the 'Email' field
    	Then I enter "Testing" in the 'Company Name' field
    	Then I enter "123 Main St." in the 'Address' field
    	Then I enter "Phoenix" in the 'City' field
    	Then I choose "Arizona" from the 'State' dropdown
    	Then I enter "85020" in the 'Zip Code' field
    	Then I check "Online Job Postings" as something I am interested in learning more about
    	Then I enter "Testing form" in the 'Questions / Comments' text area
    	Then I click the "Submit" button
    	Then I should see "The form was submitted successfully." on the page 




@temredolezal advise of writing great cucumber gherkin and automation scripts. we need to avoid imperative style like above.

we should be using declarative style describes behavior at a higher level, which I think improves the readability of the feature by abstracting out the implementation details of the application.

Scenario: Complete rental form search
   Given i visit Rentals Lite web page
   When i enter rental form search criteria 
      And i click the "Search" button
   Then the corresponding page displays


We should not hard code URLs
You are using the When and Then incorrectly, see my example below


Feature: Title (one line describing the story)

Narrative:
As a [role]
I want [feature]
So that [benefit]

Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios)

Scenario 1: Title
Given [context]
  And [some more context]...
When  [event]
Then  [outcome]
  And [another outcome]...

Scenario 2: ...
