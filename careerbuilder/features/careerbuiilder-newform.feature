Feature: New Careerbuilder Tests

	As a Gannett employee with access to the correct urls
	I want to be able to test for these scenarios
	So that the new contact form works on Careerbuilder

    Scenario: Testing form

    	Given I visit the local version of the Careerbuilder form
    	When I enter data in the required form fields
    		And I click the "Submit" button
    	Then the page will display "The form was submitted successfully."
