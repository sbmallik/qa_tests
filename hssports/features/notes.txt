Feature: High School Sports Tests

	In order to make the new features live on the High School Sports pages
	As a Gannett employee with access to the correct urls
	I want to be able to test for these scenarios

	Scenario: #1 - Find a school on the devwww pages

		Given I am on this H.S. Sports page: "http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/schedules.php?schoolid=204&sportid=3"
		When I click on the dropdown "Choose a School"
		Then I should see the option "Academy of Tucson" in the menu
		And when I am on this H.S. Sports page: "http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/scoreboard.php?gamedate=2015-10-16&sportid=3&division=2&section=6"
		And I click on the dropdown "Choose a School"
		Then I should also see the option "Academy of Tucson" in the menu


		<select class="preps-menu-select" onchange="if(this.options[this.selectedIndex].value==99999){location.href='/sports/preps/schedules.php?schoolid=204';}else{if(this.selectedIndex!=0)location.href='/sports/preps/schedules.php?schoolid='+this.options[this.selectedIndex].value;}"><option value="99999">Choose a School</option>
<option value="6">Academy of Tucson</option>

<select class="preps-menu-select" onchange="window.location.href =  '/sports/preps/schedules.php?sportid=3&amp;schoolid=' + $(this).val();">
                  <option value="">Choose a school</option>
                  <option value="6">Academy of Tucson</option>



	Scenario: #2 - Hide school in Admin

		Given I am on the admin tool in the 'Schools' section at "http://prepsportsadmin.azcentral.com/schools"
		When I click on dropdown "Select a school to update, or leave blank to create one"
		Then I click on the school "Academy of Tucson"
		And I check the box labeled "Hidden"
		And then I click on "Save Edits"


<div class="select2-container" style="width: 400px">    <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="select2-choice select2-default">   <span>Select a school to update, or leave blank to create one</span><abbr class="select2-search-choice-close" style="display: none;"></abbr>   <div><b></b></div></a>    <div class="select2-drop" style="display:none;">   <div class="select2-search">       <input type="text" autocomplete="off">   </div>   <ul class="select2-results">   </ul></div></div>

<span>Academy of Tucson</span>

		<div class="field">
<label for="school_hidden">Hidden</label>
<input name="school[hidden]" type="hidden" value="0"><input id="school_hidden" name="school[hidden]" type="checkbox" value="1">
</div>


<input name="commit" type="submit" value="Save Edits">


	Scenario: #3 - Chosen school should now be hidden on devwww pages

		Given I am on this H.S. Sports page: "http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/schedules.php?schoolid=204&sportid=3"
		When I click on the dropdown "Choose a School"
		Then I should NOT see the option "Academy of Tucson" in the menu

		And when I am on this H.S. Sports page: "http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/scoreboard.php?gamedate=2015-10-16&sportid=3&division=2&section=6"
		And I click on the dropdown "Choose a School"
		Then I should also NOT see the option "Academy of Tucson" in the menu
	




@temredolezal: phxdev-1458 is ready for QA - I forget which exact QA ticket was tied to that one, but it’s ready to go… I’m going to paste a word dump of instructions from Caleb about how to do it:

Josh Jones [2:32 PM]
```Ok so there’s 3 front end pages, all are updated only on devww right now:

http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/schedules.php?schoolid=204&sportid=3
http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/scoreboard.php?gamedate=2015-10-16&sportid=3&division=2&section=6 (edited)
http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/standings.php?sportid=3 (edited)

schedules, scoreboard, and standings.

For 1458 there is a ‘hidden’ box on both sports and schools under the manage tab in the admin tool. When you make a school or sport hidden it will no longer be inside the dropdown boxes on those 3 frontend pages. To test this one you will have to use the prod tool and the dev pages, and just revert your changes in the prod tool once you are done. These are the two admin pages: prepsportsadmin.azcentral.com/sports, http://prepsportsadmin.azcentral.com/schools.```

Please start working on this tomorrow morning - ideally I would like to have this out of QA and back to dev by COB Thursday. If that’s not possible, please let me know.

Josh Jones [2:36 PM]
1457 may also be ready to QA as well, but may not need to be QAed at all, since it’s a back end change that won’t really impact on UX. Here are the instructions for that:

```Basically when you update an event in the admin tool it puts a record at the bottom of the event page and on the logs page: devprepsportsadmin.azcentral.com/football_games

You can register for that tool on the signup page and it doesn’t require an invite or anything

and the devprepsportsadmin tool you can do whatever you want with, saving/creating games etc… its all staging data

it will have a red ‘dev’ in front of the logo so you know your not in the prod tool
```






	Scenario: #2 - Hide that school in the Admin tool

		Given I am on the admin tool in the 'Schools' section at "http://prepsportsadmin.azcentral.com/schools"
		When I click on dropdown "Select a school to update, or leave blank to create one"
		Then I click on the school "Academy of Tucson"
		And I check the box labeled "Hidden"
		And then I click on "Save Edits"


	Scenario: #3 - Chosen school should now be hidden on devwww pages

		Given I am on this H.S. Sports page again: "http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/schedules.php?schoolid=204&sportid=3"
		When I click on the dropdown "Choose a School"
		Then I should NOT see the option "Academy of Tucson" in the menu

		And when I am on this H.S. Sports page again: "http://devwww.azcentral.com/sports/preps/scoreboard.php?gamedate=2015-10-16&sportid=3&division=2&section=6"
		And when I click on the dropdown "Choose a School"
		Then I should also NOT see the option "Academy of Tucson" in the menu
