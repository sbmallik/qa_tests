From BA:
1. As the product owner, I want a module to be create to promote individual Arkadium games.

2. As the product owner, I want the module to link to the Arkadium games page when the user click on it - games.SITENAME.com.  

3. As the product owner, I want the module to display 2 Arkadium games, randomly (if possible, either when front is refreshed or with each user session based on list of games as defined in the dev config), in order for the user to be aware that additional games are available.

4. As the product owner, when the user clicks on one of the 2 games, then the user should be taken to the individual game page. 

5. As the product owner, I want the module to display additional, customizable, links that can link out to additional games, horoscopes, puzzle, and comics pages; will vary with each property. (max character link limit = 10; max links=4)

6. As the product owner, I want the games module to be available to the following pilot markets: Phoenix, Nashville, Cincinnati, Detroit and Indianapolis.

7. As the product owner, I want to track user actions: play now/header, image, headline, more links.

---------------------------------------------

Given that I'm a local market
When I want to get more users to an individual game
Then I should be able to add a promo module to any front through Presto

Given that I'm on this url "http://www.indystar.com"
When I want to make sure that the module will feature 2 games that are randomly refreshed
Then I verify that there are two headlines, images and Play Now buttons
And I verify that one links to "http://games.indystar.com/games/spider-solitaire/"
And I verify that one links to "http://games.indystar.com/games/spider-solitaire/"

Given that I'm on this url "http://www.indystar.com"
When I want to make sure that the module will feature 2 games that are randomly refreshed
Then I verify that there is a "More" section
And I verify that there are four customizable More Links for additional promotion


== Technical Notes ==

Make the promo tile a configurable item to display via web-config
