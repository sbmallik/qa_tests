    As a public user of the Internet and not authenticated
    I want to open the Rentals Lite application and see certain features


	Scenario: User visits simple rentals front on desktop

		Given that I am on the Rentals Lite web page
		Then the user is presented with a standard GDP front with header, left suspender and footer
		And the top module in the center well will display an Apartments search widget
		And the widget will provide a search field that will accept "city", "zip code", "neighborhood", "address", and "property name"
		And the widget will provide drop-down searches for: "Min Rent", "Max Rent", "Beds", "Baths", and "Pets"

 		Given that I am on the Rentals Lite web page
		Then a classifieds module is displayed left-center
		And that classifieds module provides a "simple search" widget
		And the link to the search should be configurable

		Given that I am on the Rentals Lite web page
		Then two (2) image links are displayed
		And text links are to be displayed below the images
