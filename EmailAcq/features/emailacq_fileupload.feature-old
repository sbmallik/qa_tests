Feature: Upload file to Email Acquisition app 

   As a Gannett employee with access to the correct urls
   I want to be able to test for these scenarios
   So that the new form works on the new Email Acquisition app

   Scenario: Upload file to App
      
      Given I am on the file uploader page
      When I attach the correct file in the Downloads folder
      Then I click the 'Upload' button
      And then those emails should be received in Exact Target
